% Generation of OFDM Signals
% An unmodulated OFDM signal maybe written as 
% s(t) = real(sum(e^(1j*pi*n*fc*t)))

%% a) Plot the time waveform for each of the four subcarriers using f0 = 1.

%% b) Plot the spectrum for each of the four subcarriers on the same plot.

%% c) Determine the minimum subcarrier symbol duration Ts such that the subcarriers are orthogonal

%% d) Determine the minimum subcarrier symbol such that the  subcarriers are orthogonal

% Ensure each subcarrier has a random phase offset Î¸n
