%% 2 Channel Estimation and Equalization
% Summary: 
% Channel estimation in (OFDM): 
% Ensures high-quality data transmission over
% wireless channels. 
%
% Channel Equalization: 
% Once the channel response is estimated for all subcarriers, this 
% information is used to equalize the received signal, effectively mitigating
% the channel impairments. The equalization adjusts the amplitude and phase
% of each subcarrier to counteract the channel's effects.
%
% Benefits: 
% Enables the receiver to accurately decode the transmitted data despite 
% the impairments introduced by the wireless channel

%% 2.2.a Find the start time of the packet using the cross-correlation
% modulate the bpsk training seq to an OFDM symbol


%% 2.2.a.i Determine the frequency offset f0
% average over every sample contained within each training sequence

%% 2.2.a.ii Once you have determined f0, correct your entire packet by applying a frequency offset of âˆ’f0 
% (i.e. de-rotating your packet).

%% 2.2.a.iii After you have removed the frequency offset, estimate the frequency domain channel coefficients H

%% 2.2.a.iv For the first OFDM block find and remove the cyclic prefix (CP) and then demodulate the OFDM block using the FFT.

%% 2.2.a.v For the first OFDM block, apply the frequency domain equalizer G.

%% 2.2.a.vi Apply the equalizer to the entire packet.
